## Analysis of Standardized Testing

Using Pandas found I created a summary and analysis of all the schools in the area.
In the End of the Jupyter Notebook files is my analysis of the results.

## Analysis and Trends

- Students from Charter Schools outpreformed students from District Schools in all categories - with 36% more students passing both math and reading.

- Students from the largest categories of school were outpreformed by students from medium and small school scoring over 30% more students passing both math and reading.

- School spending more money per student did not increase the average grade of the students or whether they passed. As spending increased the average grade deacreased.
